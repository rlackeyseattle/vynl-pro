My goal is to eliminate all the guess work in\r\noffering a complete and intuitive version.\r\n\r\nSection Details\r\n\r\nIntro/Main riff: |[C#] [D#] >E >F |[C#] [D#] >E >F# |[C#]   [A]    |[C#]   [A]    | (x2)\r\n\r\n(moderately fast)\r\n\r\n | [C#]      [D#]  > [E]       > [F#]      |       -------------+\r\n:| 1 . & . 2 . & . 3 . & . 4 . & . |                    |\r\ne|---------------------------------|                    |\r\nB|---------------------------------|                    |\r\nG|-6---6-x-8-8-/-9-9-9-x-/-11x-11x-|                    |\r\nD|-x---x-x-x-x-/-x-x-x-x-/-x-x-x-x-|                    |\r\nA|-4---4-x-6-6-/-7-7-7-x-/-9-x-9-x-|                    |\r\nE|---------------------------------|: (x2)              |\r\n                                                        |\r\nthen...                                                 +---- play twice\r\n                                                        |\r\n | [C#]              [A]               |                    |\r\n:| 1 . & . 2 . & . 3 . & . 4 . & . |                    |\r\ne|---------------------------------|                    |\r\nB|---------------------------------|                    |\r\nG|-6(6)6(6)6-x-x-x-----------------|                    |\r\nD|-6(6)6(4)6-x-x-x-7-5h7-5h7-x-x-x-|                    |\r\nA|-4(4)4(4)4-x-x-x-7-5h7-5h7-x-x-x-|                    |\r\nE|-----------------5-5-5-5-5-x-x-x-|: (x2) -------------+\r\n \"(head,   head,   head,   head-head)\"\r\n                          \"Breathe...\" (on last pass)\r\n\r\nVerse: |[C#]    |[C#]    |[A]     |[A]     | (as needed)\r\n\r\n(\"Breathe\" Part shown, but same for all verse sections)\r\n\r\n\"Breathe...\"\r\n\r\n | C#                              |       -------------+\r\n:| 1 . & . 2 . & . 3 . & . 4 . & . |                    |\r\ne|---------------------------------|                    |\r\nB|---------------------------------|                    |\r\nG|-6(6)6---x-x-x---6-4h6-4h6-x-x-x-|                    |\r\nD|-6(6)6---x-x-x---6-4h6-4h6-x-x-x-|                    |\r\nA|-4(4)4---x-x-x---4-4-4-4-4-x-x-x-|                    |\r\nE|---------------------------------|: (x2)              |\r\n1)\"in...   breathe out...   breathe\"                    |\r\n2)\"in...   breathe out...   breathe\"                    |\r\n                                                        +---- play twice\r\nthen...                                                 |\r\n                                                        |\r\n | [A]                               |                    |\r\n:| 1 . & . 2 . & . 3 . & . 4 . & . |                    |\r\ne|---------------------------------|                    |\r\nB|---------------------------------|                    |\r\nG|---------------------------------|                    |\r\nD|-7(7)7---x-x-x---7-5h7-5h7-x-x-x-|                    |\r\nA|-7(7)7---x-x-x---7-5h7-5h7-x-x-x-|                    |\r\nE|-5(5)5---x-x-x---5-5-5-5-5-x-x-x-|: (x2) -------------+\r\n1)\"in.\"\r\n2)                         \"Breathe...\" (when repeating)\r\n                   \"Tied   to  a......\" (before verse 1)\r\n                   \"Deaf, dumb, and...\" (before verse 2)\r\n\r\nChorus: |E   B   |C#   A* | (x4) *A not played on last pass, hold C#\r\n\r\n | [E]               [B]               | [C#]              [A]               |\r\n:| 1 . & . 2 . & . 3 . & . 4 . & . | 1 . & . 2 . & . 3 . & . 4 . & . |\r\ne|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|\r\nB|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|\r\nG|-9---9---9-x-x-x-----------------|-6---6---6-x-x-x-----------------|\r\nD|-9---9---9-x-x-x-9-9--9--9-x-9-x-|-6---6---6-x-x-x-7-7--7--7-x-7-x-|\r\nA|-7---7---7-x-x-x-9-9--9--9-x-9-x-|-4---4---4-x-x-x-7-7--7--7-x-7-x-|\r\nE|-----------------7-7--7--7-x-7-x-|-----------------5-5--5--5-x-5-x-|: (x3)\r\n1)        \"Got a   ma--chine.....   head!...

It is important to remember\r\nto hit the bass notes perfectly.  The first bass note is a C#, A, B, E, G#,\r\nA, B, E... and so on and so on.  You'll notice Dave and Steffan doing the\r\nsame in most concerts.  You'll need to listen to the song to get the write\r\nrythm down, it shouldn't be too difficult at all.\r\nWhen he say's \"Crash, into me, yeah\"  it goes like this:\r\nthe notes with (*) by them are just bass notes G#, A, B\r\n\r\n[E]      [G#]*   [A]* [B]*  [D/F#]\r\nCrash, In    to Me, Yeah               [D/F#]: 2x0230\r\n\r\nAfter this, the standard progression starts over.  Have fun, it's a\r\nbeautiful song.",

      "lyrics": "Well here again another tab for the song Faith from George Michael.. It's really a cool song\r\nand if you got the rythm and stuff it's SO cool to play it.. First this is the strum:\r\n\r\n **  ** * *     **\r\nnvnv nvnv nvn n nv (n=downstroke, v=upstroke)\r\n\r\nIt maybe looks a little weird (I have to admit), but the stars are where you have to damp\r\nyour strings, hear the song if you don't understand\r\nme.. it's played very fast and I had to practise a long time before I\r\ncould really play it, but if you can it's really cool like I said\r\nalready.\r\nHere are all the chords:\r\n\r\n[Intro]\r\n\r\n|[B]   |[B]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Verse 1]\r\n\r\n|[B]   |[B]   |[E]   |[B]   2x\r\nWell I guess it would be nice if I could touch your body\r\nI know not everybody has got a body like you\r\nBut I've got to think twice before I give my heart away\r\nAnd I know all the games you play because I played them too\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pre-chorus]\r\n\r\n|[E]   |[B]   |[E]   |[B]   |[E]   |[B] [G#m] |[C#m]   |[F#]   \r\nBut I need some time off from that emotion\r\nTime to pick my heart up off the floor\r\nWhen that love comes down without devotion\r\nWell it takes a strong man, baby\r\nBut I'm showing you the door\r\n\r\n\r\n[Chorus]\r\n\r\n|[B]   |[B]   |[B]   |[B]   \r\nCause I've got to have faith\r\nI've got to have faith\r\nBecause I've got to have faith, faith, faith\r\nI've got to have faith, faith, faith\r\n\r\n\r\n[Verse 2]\r\n\r\n|[B]   |[B]   |[E]   |[B]   2x\r\nBaby I know you're asking me to stay\r\nSay please, please, please don't go away\r\nYou say I'm giving you the blues\r\nMaybe you mean every word you say\r\nCan't help but think of yesterday\r\nAnd another who tied me down to loverboy rules\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pre-chorus]\r\n\r\n|[E]   |[B]   |[E]   |[B]   |[E]   |[B] [G#m] |[C#m]   |[F#]   \r\nBefore this river becomes an ocean\r\nBefore you throw my heart back on the floor\r\nOh baby I reconsider my foolish notion\r\nWell I need someone to hold me but I'll wait for something more\r\n\r\n\r\n[Chorus]\r\n\r\n|[B]   |[B]   |[B]   |[B]   \r\nCause I've got to have faith\r\nI've got to have faith\r\nBecause I've got to have faith, faith, faith\r\nI've got to have faith, faith, faith\r\nBridge\r\n|[B]   |[B]   |[E]   |[B]   2x\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pre-chorus]\r\n\r\n|[E]   |[B]   |[E]   |[B]   |[E]   |[B] [G#m] |[C#m]   |[F#]   \r\nBefore this river becomes an ocean\r\nBefore you throw my heart back on the floor\r\nOh baby I reconsider my foolish notion\r\nWell I need someone to hold me but I'll wait for something more\r\n\r\n\r\n[Chorus]\r\n\r\n|[B]   |[B]   |[B]   |[B]   \r\nCause I've got to have faith\r\nI've got to have faith\r\nBecause I've got to have faith, faith, faith\r\nI've got to have faith, faith, faith\r\n\r\n\r\n[Bridge]\r\n\r\n|[B]   |[B]   |[E]   |[B]   2x\r\n\r\n[B] = 7998777\r\n[E] = *79997\r\n[G#m] = *(11)(13)(13)(12)(11)\r\n[C#m] = 9(11)(11)999\r\n[F#] = *9(11)(11)(11)9\r\n(the '()' is just a normal 11 but it looks a little weird if I don't\r\ndo that, looks like you have to play the F#-chord in 8 strings in an impossible way..\r\n\r\nIf there are no chords in the second pre-chorus and chorus it wants to say you have to play\r\nthe other pre-chorus and chorus, but you already noticed I\r\nthink ;)\r\n\r\nIn the pre-chorus there are these chords: |B G#m |C#m\r\nThe B is standing close to the G#m and the G#m close to the C#m.. It wants to say you have\r\nto play 2 seconds B and 2 seconds G#m, I would give you\r\na sample of the strum:\r\n\r\n[B]          [G#m]\r\n **  ** * *    **\r\nnvnv nvnv nvn n nv\r\nIt's the same, but now you have to go to G#m after two seconds.. The C#m is just like I said\r\nalready.\r\n\r\nHope you like it, and rate and comment it!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************\r\n\r\n| (the '()' is just a normal \r\n| **  ** * *    ** \r\n| Well I guess it would be nice if I could touch your body \r\n| but it looks a little weird if I don't \r\n\r\n************************************",

I actually play the keyboard and guitar lines at \r\nthe same time using a volume pedal on my guitar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Intro]\r\n\r\n[Dm]  [C]  [Bb]  [C]  x2\r\n\r\n\r\n[Chorus]\r\n\r\n[Dm]                [C]                   [Bb]          [C]\r\n   I can feel it coming in the air tonight... oh Lord\r\n[Dm]                            [C]                    [Bb]        [C]\r\n   I've been waiting for this moment.. for all my life.. oh Lord\r\n[Dm]                  [C]                   [Bb]         [C]\r\n   Can you feel it coming in the air tonight.. oh Lord?\r\n    [Dm]\r\nOh Lord\r\n\r\n\r\n[Verse 1]\r\n\r\n         [Dm]\r\nWell, if you told me you were drowning\r\n  [C]\r\nI would not lend a hand\r\n     [Bb]\r\nI've seen your face before, my friend\r\n            [F]\r\nBut I don't know if you know who I am\r\n    [Dm]\r\nBut I was there and I saw what you did\r\n[C]\r\nSaw it with my own two eyes\r\n           [Bb]\r\nSo you can wipe off that grin...

Live the song is played in 'G' which makes me think that this was\r\npossibly played in 'G' but his guitar was maybe out of tune. To transpose F#=G,\r\nB=C and C#=D...or tune down slightly.",
